    Kevin Bacon Game
    
    Kevin Bacon is an actor in many films. As a result of his fame, many actors
    play a game where they try to figure out the fewest connections between cast
    members to Kevin Bacon.
    
    e.g. Harrison Ford's "Bacon Number" is 2:
            Harrison Ford and Karen Allen appeared in Raiders of the Lost Ark.
            Karen Allen and Kevin Bacon appeared in Animal House.
            
    (You can type "Bacon Number X" where X is the actor's name into Google.)
    
    Given a list of movies with the full cast names, create a data structure to
    store an actor's past cast members and find their Bacon Number. Kevin Bacon's
    own Bacon Number is zero, and -1 indicates there are no listed connections
    in the data set.
